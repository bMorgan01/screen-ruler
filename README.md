# screen-ruler
This is an easy-to-use pixel screen ruler.

Use the white boxes in the lower right-hand corner to move and resize the ruler.
Scroll on the ruler to measure magnified images. Match the magnification label (i.e 'x5') with the magnification of your image (i.e 500%). This is helpful when measuring small distances accurately.
